## Description
This has the completed (ish) VideoFabricWithZoom feature

Feature: videoFabricWithZoom
This has:
- Video.js player
- Fabric.js canvas for drawing on top of the video
- Minimap + navigator when zoomed in
- Zoom feature
- and ... *nothing else* <- important

A testbench page is here:
http://localhost:5173/tests/video-layer

"ish" because, when you come to use it - as part of something larger - a collection of features = a recipe - it will need some very small updates. The obvious ones are:
* export the current playhead position, so a timeline can track it, and hh:mm:ss:ff can be displayed
* import the ability to seek, play/pause, etc
* you may want a nicer Zoom control
The rule is - do as little as possible inside this feature. It's about the size where AI currently works well. You definitely do not want it a lot bigger.

### Architecture
It got too big and was trying to be too clever. While absolutely lovely it was simply too big. AI works best with small and tight.

Plus, I also logged the Plan and the after Review. (If you dig around Claude chats you will find the gory details, but actually following the sequence is almost impossible; I used the Chat branching technique often.
