# Markdown Cheat Sheet

Thanks for visiting [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)!

This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements. It canâ€™t cover every edge case, so if you need more information about any of these elements, refer to the reference guides for [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/).

**Try those links, or, move your cursor into this paragraph then over the links to see the formatting.** To create a link to a webpage: [text for the link](https://example.com/) - or, to **link to a page in your vault** (create a **local link**): [[Resources/some page]] - or, to link to a header in your vault (another local link): [[Resources/some page#Header]] - or, to change the text for a local link: use the | character: [[Resources/some page|this will show up instead]]

## Extended Syntax

These elements extend the basic syntax by adding additional features. Not all Markdown applications support these elements.

### Table

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

### Fenced Code Block

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

### Footnote

Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.

### Heading ID

### My Great Heading {#custom-id}

### Definition List

term
: definition

### Strikethrough

~~The world is flat.~~

### Task List

- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media

### Emoji - type a : + no space + type what you want, to see a list

Example 1: That is so funny! ðŸ¤£  <- I typed a : + started typing laugh, and then selected it from the list

Example 2:
Community plug-in **Iconize** supports icon packs. **Place your cursor in this paragraph to see the codes!** You can optionally add or remove different packs. To use: Begin the icon name with the icon pack prefix - e.g. Font Awesome Regular = "far" = type a : then 'far' then start typing the icon e.g. HandSpock = :FarHandSpock: or, Lucide Icons = "li" = type a : then 'li' then start typing the icon name e.g. Handshake = :LiHandshake:

### Highlight

I need to highlight these ==very important words==.

### Subscript - NON STANDARD!

'official' markdown syntax is "bracket the subscript with ~" ... but that doesn't seem to work!
H~2~O

However, we can do it by using HTML! Move your cursor into this to see how it works:
H<sub>2</sub>O

### Superscript - NON STANDARD!

Same issue!
'official' markdown syntax is "bracket the superscript with ^" ... but that doesn't seem to work!
X^2^

Here's the HTML version:
X<sup>2</sup>
