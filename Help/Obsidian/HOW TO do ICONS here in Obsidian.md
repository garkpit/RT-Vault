Obsidian comes with Lucide Icons and you can add others. I have added Font Awesome Regular. If you guys want more then just ask me (or figure it out yourself).
## HOW TO insert an icon
You type a colon
then either 'far' or 'li' <- identifies which Icon Pack you are referring to
then start typing the name of the icon
then either finish typing with a colon
or select from the drop down list

**NOTE: No spaces!**

# 'Normal' icons also work
On a Mac these are trivially easy to use: 😀😱👀🧠🔚🔙🔝🔜🏴‍☠️⛔️👽🥳🥸🙄🤪
On a PC I have no idea, sorry
