# Hello!
GitHub repositories *like* having a README.md file in the root
So, please don't delete this file :FarFaceLaughBeam: 

> This is just Mike making a comment... will wait here to see if Ross manages to do the same ;)

> Jay here - Brownie points if he manages it. Double if he makes the formatting nice :FarPenToSquare:

# Welcome to RT++ Vault
## An Obsidian vault
### Shared between Jay, Mike, and Ross


# IMPORTANT THINGS
## 1 - DO NOT USE THIS VAULT ON MOBILE 
### (so says the git plugin docs)
## 2 - Do not use funky characters in the title of any notes
### like > or < or : or ? (etc)
### (because it breaks sharing for PC users like Mike)
