Here's the chat of the Professor - https://claude.ai/share/52a21958-26fb-4c29-9fd9-3d5606485070 - Done in a web browser (does not need file system access)
Claude Sonnet 4, without extended thinking - is fine

Here's the Claude Desktop chat, we're iterating through the planning interactively. You don't have to do it this way, but it was easier to show Mike the complete flow for brownfield refactoring this way. When you start a greenfield then it is definitely different (try it!) -

Claude Opus 4.1 with Extended Thinking enabled

Dev, QA, SM - iterate in Claude Code (always in Opus 4.1 mode ideally)
No 'chats' to save, but I do try to keep good info in the commit messages.
*Commit every time!*

Because I am chatting with 3 different Claude's, it is almost impossible to capture the exact flow. I did show Mike!
