# Product Approvals Module - Brainstorming Session Report

## Summary

This transcript captures a brainstorming session between Ross (Speaker 1/Jay) and an unnamed collaborator (Speaker 2) discussing the development of a new video approvals module. The system is designed as a collaborative workflow tool that allows multiple team members to review, comment on, and approve various types of content (videos, photographs, documents) through an iterative versioning process.

The core concept revolves around a cyclical approval process where content is submitted, reviewed by a team of approvers who can make comments and annotations, and then potentially revised and resubmitted until all team members approve the final version. The discussion covers team structure with role-based permissions, real-time collaboration features, annotation tools, and the technical architecture needed to support various content types through a layered approach.

## Features Discussed

### Team Management & Permissions
• Role-based team structure with a manager/supervisor at the top
• Creation of approval teams for specific projects
• Multiple permission levels for team members (view, comment, etc.)
• Manager role to coordinate and corral comments from team members
• Permission settings to control which team members can see others' comments
• User color assignment for easy identification of comments and annotations
• Font and font size customization options controlled by supervisor

### Notification & Alert System
• Email notifications when videos/content are uploaded for review
• In-app notification system with alert counters on dashboard
• Configurable email alerts (users can opt in/out)
• Alerts when comments are made or status changes occur
• Team member notifications when new versions are uploaded

### Content Status Management
• Object status tracking (new, under review, approved)
• Individual user status settings (reviewing, approved, not started)
• Overall project status visibility showing team progress
• Status change notifications and alerts

### Version Control & File Management
• Version control system for iterative content review
• Container system for organizing different versions
• Finder-like UI for file organization and hierarchy
• Parent-child relationship tracking between versions
• Ability to review and reference previous versions
• Clean filing system for version history

### Annotation & Drawing Tools
• Pencil drawing tool with variable line thickness
• Multiple color options for drawing tools
• Rectangle/box drawing with optional text inside
• Text insertion capability
• Box fill options (transparent, colored, semi-transparent)
• Eraser tool
• Highlighter pen functionality
• Arrow drawing tools including curved connecting arrows
• Basic shapes (triangle, circle, square)
• Straight and curved line tools
• Icon library with expandable/bolt-on capability
• Reaction icons (thumbs up, thumbs down, smiley face, sad face, heart)
• Sticker functionality for quick feedback

### Timeline & Video-Specific Features
• Timeline marking for in/out points on videos
• Time-based comments linked to specific video segments
• Timeline metadata editor integration
• Row-based comment organization (each person gets their own row)
• Supervisor ability to enable/disable different comment rows
• Independent review of each team member's timeline comments

### Real-Time Collaboration
• Simultaneous review capability (multiple users reviewing same content)
• Teams-style commenting and interaction system
• Comment threading and response functionality
• Real-time comment visibility and interaction
• Quick acknowledgment tools (thumbs up on comments/annotations)

### Zoom & Transformation Features
• Zoom in/out functionality (up to 300% mentioned)
• Annotation capability at any zoom level
• Proportional scaling of annotations when zooming
• No flipping or complex transformations for MVP
• Support for annotating while viewing different portions of content

### Multi-Content Type Support
• Video file support as primary focus
• Photograph/image support
• Document support (including PDFs with scrolling)
• Future 3D object support through modular layer system
• Multiple file support for complex objects (e.g., multiple photos of a product)
• Dropdown selection for viewing different files in a set

### Technical Architecture
• Layered system with transparent annotation layer over content layer
• Modular design to support different content types (3JS for 3D, WebGL)
• Abstraction layer for easy integration of new content types
• Transformation tracking for 3D objects and complex content
• Comment association with specific transformations/views

### User Interface Features
• Clean, normalized UI similar to Finder
• Drop-and-drag file functionality
• Dashboard with project overview
• Team member visibility on sidebar
• Comment organization to prevent "stream of consciousness" confusion
• Permission-based row visibility for comments
