# Product Approvals Module - Product Requirements Document

## Document Information
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** August 22, 2025
- **Status:** Draft
- **Product Manager:** TBD
- **Engineering Lead:** Jay/Ross

## Executive Summary

The Product Approvals Module is a collaborative workflow system designed to streamline the review and approval process for digital content including videos, images, documents, and future 3D objects. The system enables teams to review content through iterative cycles with annotations, comments, and version control until all stakeholders approve the final version.

## Problem Statement

Current content approval processes are fragmented, inefficient, and lack proper version control. Teams struggle with:
- Disorganized feedback across multiple communication channels
- No centralized system for tracking approval status
- Difficulty managing multiple content versions
- Lack of visual annotation tools for precise feedback
- No role-based permission system for approval workflows

## Goals and Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- Reduce content approval cycle time by 50%
- Increase approval workflow completion rate to 95%
- Centralize all approval communications in one platform
- Enable real-time collaborative review processes

### Success Metrics
- Time from initial submission to final approval
- Number of revision cycles required per project
- User adoption rate across teams
- Reduction in external communication tools used for approvals
