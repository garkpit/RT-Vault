## PROMPT
What are the next steps? Explain how I go from PRD to working MVP system. Note I will be using an AI Coding Assistant (probably Claude Code) and I expect I will use a framework to help - for example take a look a the BMAD-method here: [https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) - read the documentation there and any linked documentation files.

## RESPONSE
I'll analyze the BMAD-METHOD framework to understand how it can help accelerate your MVP development, then outline the next steps from PRD to working system.Based on my analysis of the BMAD-METHOD framework and your PRD, here's your complete roadmap from PRD to working MVP system:

## Next Steps: PRD to Working MVP System

### Phase 1: Setup and Planning Enhancement (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Install BMAD-METHOD Framework

```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

- This sets up the AI agent framework with specialized roles
- Creates proper directory structure for docs, stories, and development cycles

#### 1.2 Enhance Your PRD with BMAD Agents

Even though you have a solid PRD, BMAD's planning agents can refine it:

**Use the PM Agent** (in web UI with Claude/Gemini):

- Upload your existing PRD
- Have the PM agent review and enhance it with BMAD's structured format
- Ensure all functional requirements are properly detailed for AI development

**Use the Architect Agent**:

- Create a detailed technical architecture document
- Define the modular layered system (annotation layer + content layer)
- Specify technology stack (React, Node.js, WebSocket, etc.)
- Design database schema for users, teams, content, versions, comments

### Phase 2: Document Sharding and Story Creation (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Critical Transition: Move to IDE

Once you have refined PRD and Architecture docs:

- Copy `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` to your project
- Switch from web UI to your IDE (preferably with Claude Code integration)

#### 2.2 Document Sharding with PO Agent

Use the Product Owner (PO) agent to:

- Shard the PRD into specific epics (`docs/epics/`)
- Break epics into implementable user stories (`docs/stories/`)
- Ensure each story contains complete context for development

**Example Epic Breakdown for Your MVP:**

- Epic 1: User Management & Authentication
- Epic 2: Team Management & Permissions
- Epic 3: Content Upload & Basic Video Player
- Epic 4: Annotation System (Core Tools)
- Epic 5: Comment System & Real-time Collaboration
- Epic 6: Basic Approval Workflow

### Phase 3: Technology Stack Setup (Week 2-3)

#### 3.1 Choose Your Stack

Based on your PRD requirements, I recommend:

- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for structured data) + File storage
- **Real-time:** Socket.io for collaboration
- **Authentication:** JWT or Auth0
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 or similar cloud storage

#### 3.2 Project Initialization

```bash
# Create project structure
npx create-react-app product-approvals --template typescript
cd product-approvals
npm install @types/node socket.io-client axios
```

### Phase 4: Core Development Cycle with BMAD (Weeks 3-8)

#### 4.1 BMAD Development Workflow

BMAD follows this cycle for each story:

```
SM Agent → Creates detailed implementation story from epic
↓
Dev Agent → Implements the code based on story requirements  
↓
QA Agent → Reviews and tests the implementation
↓
Back to SM → Next story iteration
```

#### 4.2 Start with Foundation Stories

**Week 3-4: Foundation**

1. **Story 1:** Basic project setup and authentication
2. **Story 2:** User management system
3. **Story 3:** Team creation and management
4. **Story 4:** Basic file upload system

**Week 5-6: Core Features** 5. **Story 5:** Video player component 6. **Story 6:** Basic annotation layer system 7. **Story 7:** Drawing tools (pencil, rectangle, text) 8. **Story 8:** Comment system foundation

**Week 7-8: MVP Completion** 9. **Story 9:** Real-time collaboration 10. **Story 10:** Approval workflow 11. **Story 11:** Version control system 12. **Story 12:** Notification system

### Phase 5: Claude Code Integration Strategy

#### 5.1 Use Claude Code for Development

Claude Code excels at:

- **Contextual Development:** Understanding your entire codebase
- **Architecture Consistency:** Maintaining your modular design
- **Complex Feature Implementation:** Building the annotation system
- **Testing Strategy:** Creating comprehensive test suites

#### 5.2 Claude Code Best Practices for Your Project

```bash
# Use Claude Code to:
claude-code "Implement the annotation layer component with drawing tools based on our architecture"
claude-code "Add real-time collaboration using Socket.io for the comment system"
claude-code "Create the version control system for content management"
```

### Phase 6: BMAD Advantages for Your Project

#### 6.1 Why BMAD Method is Perfect for Product Approvals

1. **Complex Requirements:** Your system has intricate user flows that benefit from detailed story breakdown
2. **Modular Architecture:** BMAD's structured approach aligns with your layered system design
3. **Multiple User Types:** BMAD handles complex permission systems well
4. **Real-time Features:** Framework supports collaborative development patterns

#### 6.2 Key BMAD Features for Your Success

- **Context Engineering:** Each story contains full implementation context
- **Agentic Planning:** Specialized agents handle different aspects (PM, Architect, Dev, QA)
- **Consistent Quality:** Built-in QA processes ensure robust code
- **Modular Development:** Perfect for your annotation + content layer architecture

### Phase 7: MVP Validation and Iteration (Weeks 9-10)

#### 7.1 Deploy MVP

- Set up basic deployment (Vercel, Netlify, or AWS)
- Test with real users from your organization
- Gather feedback on core workflow

#### 7.2 Iterate with BMAD

- Use Analyst agent to process user feedback
- PM agent to prioritize new features
- Architect agent to plan Phase 2 enhancements

## Recommended Starting Command

```bash
# 1. Set up BMAD
npx bmad-method install

# 2. Create your project
mkdir product-approvals-system
cd product-approvals-system

# 3. Copy your PRD to docs/prd.md
# 4. Use BMAD web UI to create architecture.md
# 5. Switch to IDE and start development cycle
```

## Success Factors

1. **Follow BMAD Workflow Strictly:** Don't skip the planning phase or document sharding
2. **Start Small:** Begin with the most basic approval workflow
3. **Use Claude Code Integration:** Perfect for your complex annotation system
4. **Iterate Fast:** BMAD enables rapid iteration based on feedback
5. **Leverage Real-time Collaboration:** BMAD handles complex collaborative features well

The combination of your well-structured PRD + BMAD's systematic approach + Claude Code's development capabilities creates an ideal environment for building your Product Approvals MVP efficiently and maintainably.
