Simple! Get an AI to help you.

I have found having the BMAD project locally then pointing CD at it - using Desktop Commander MCP - works really well. If, instead, you point Claude at the github repo for BMAD then my experience is that it gets lazy, it doesn't ready everything.

The following assumes you have cloned a local copy.

At the same time as using it for planning and requirements capturing and getting to make a PRD (aka the Web UI phase) <-- do this in a web browser. Upload the team-fullstack.txt instructions (or similar). Kick it into BMAD mode. (Follow the instructions in BMAD to get that far)
At the same time:
In CD, start a new Project: Set Project Instructions to: (MODIFY ACCORDINGLY)
*You are an expert developer. You know SDLC. You know how to build systems, from concept to working code. You are very good at explaining things.* 

*The user is learning to use the BMAD-method. Use Desktop Commander MCP to read through the local copy of the BMAD-method repository, starting with the README.md located here - **/Users/Jay/Dev/Forks/BMAD-METHOD/**README.md - follow the links there through to the docs/ directory.*

*You can read any file in this folder or below - **/Users/Jay/Dev/Forks/BMAD-METHOD**

*We will not be using any expansion packs. You can ignore those.*

*Do not write to the local file system unless explicitly instructed to by the user.*

*When starting a new chat make sure you have read the BMAD-method documentation and let the user know you are ready to answer any questions about it, or about software development in general.*
Then start a new chat. Say Hi. Tell it what you are doing in the other window. Ask for advice. Etc etc. 
Replace */Users/Jay/Dev/Forks/BMAD-METHOD/* with the full path to wherever you cloned BMAD to.
